# Mas Sular storefront — production image (Next.js standalone).
#
# `output: 'standalone'` makes Next trace the modules the server actually
# reaches and emit them next to server.js, so the runtime stage copies a
# ready-to-run tree instead of installing dependencies a second time.
#
# IMPORTANT — NEXT_PUBLIC_* are inlined into the client bundle at BUILD time.
# They are build arguments, not runtime env: changing one requires a rebuild.
# They are public by definition; never pass a secret this way.

# F59 (Option A): strip package managers from the RUNTIME image. Nothing here
# invokes them — the app is `node server.js` and the healthcheck is
# `node -e fetch(...)` — but `npx <anything>` is the most convenient way to run
# arbitrary remote code after an RCE, and this service has egress via `edge`.
# Safe because they are self-contained symlink targets: node is a standalone
# binary at /usr/local/bin/node and is untouched.
# NOT removed: sh/busybox (CMD-SHELL healthchecks and docker exec depend on it),
# dumb-init, node. BusyBox therefore still exposes wget/nc as applets — accepted
# residual risk; removing the /usr/bin/wget symlink would be cosmetic only.
